## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the backend application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React application:
   ```
   npm start

## Usage

Once both the backend and frontend are running, you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The frontend will communicate with the backend API to fetch and send data.
