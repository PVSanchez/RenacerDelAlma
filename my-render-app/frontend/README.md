# Frontend React Application

This is the frontend part of the my-render-app project, built using React.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-render-app/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   To start the development server, use:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the React application and open it in your default web browser.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the React application.
  - `App.jsx`: The main component of the application.
  - `index.jsx`: The entry point for the React application.
- `public/`: Contains static files.
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file for the application.

## Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, run:
```
npm run build
```
This will generate a `build` directory with the optimized production files.
